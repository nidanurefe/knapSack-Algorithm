# Knapsack Problem Solutions in Assembly

This repository contains two solutions for the **Knapsack Problem** implemented in **Assembly language**. The solutions include:

1. **Iterative Approach**: Solves the knapsack problem using an iterative method.
2. **Recursive Approach**: Solves the knapsack problem using recursion.

## Knapsack Problem Overview

The knapsack problem is a classic optimization problem that involves selecting items with given weights and values to maximize the total value without exceeding a specified weight limit. It is commonly used in computer science to illustrate dynamic programming techniques.

### Problem Statement:
Given:
- A set of items, each with a weight and a value.
- A maximum weight capacity for the knapsack.

Find the maximum total value that can be obtained by selecting a subset of the items such that the total weight does not exceed the capacity.

1. **`iterative.asm`**  
   Implements the iterative approach to solve the knapsack problem. This method uses loops to compute the optimal solution and stores intermediate results in a table.

2. **`recursive.asm`**  
   Implements the recursive approach to solve the knapsack problem. This method uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to compute the optimal solution, exploring all possible subsets.
